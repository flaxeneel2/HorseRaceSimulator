# Horse Race simulator

This project is a 2 part project for making a horse race betting simulator.

Part 1 is the start of the program as a text-only program, without features such as statistics, a UI, etc.

Part 2 is the GUI version made using java swing.

## Running the program

### Part 1

You can build the project using the following command:
`mvn compile exec:java -pl Part1 -am`

### Part 2

You can build the project using the following command:
`mvn compile exec:java -pl Part2 -am`


#### Known issues with part 2

- More accurate horse odds do not populate on random horses until at least 3 runs have been done with the random horse.
